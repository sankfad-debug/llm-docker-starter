## Introduction

The **LLM Docker Starter** is designed to simplify the deployment of large language models. It leverages Docker and Docker Compose to create a flexible and reproducible environment. This approach allows you to manage dependencies and isolate your applications easily.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with pre-defined Docker configurations.
- **Modular Design**: Customize your environment by modifying Dockerfiles and Compose files.
- **Scalability**: Deploy multiple instances of your application as needed.
- **Isolation**: Keep your projects separate to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/sankfad-debug/llm-docker-starter/releases). Make sure to execute the downloaded files to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sankfad-debug/llm-docker-starter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd llm-docker-starter
   ```

3. Pull the necessary Docker images:

   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   ```

4. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage

Once your environment is up and running, you can begin using the language models. The service will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can access the API or the web interface, depending on your configuration.

### Example API Call

You can make a simple API call using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate -d '{"prompt": "Hello, world!"}'
```

This call will return a response from the language model based on the prompt provided.

## Configuration

You can customize your Docker and Docker Compose settings by editing the following files:

- **Dockerfile**: Modify the base image and dependencies.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Adjust service configurations, environment variables, and ports.

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in the `.env` file. This file allows you to configure sensitive data like API keys or database credentials without hardcoding them into your code.
